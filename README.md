# webpage-compliance-checker

The task is to build an API that does the following:

Take a webpage as the input and it has to check the content in the page against a compliance policy
Return the findings (non-compliant results) in the response
As an example, we take

Stripe's public compliance policy: https://stripe.com/docs/treasury/marketing-treasury Lets test it against https://www.joinguava.com/

The task is to build a simple API in any language that checks the webpage copy against the policy and report the findings. You can use OpenAI or any open-source LLMs for this purpose
